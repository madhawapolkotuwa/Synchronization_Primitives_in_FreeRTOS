# üîë Synchronization Primitives in FreeRTOS
## 1. Binary Semaphore
* Works like an ON/OFF flag.
* Commonly used for` task-to-task` or `ISR-to-task` signaling.
* Example: An ISR ‚Äúgives‚Äù the semaphore when data is ready, and a task ‚Äútakes‚Äù it to
process the data.
## 2. Counting Semaphore
* Similar to binary, but the semaphore value can be greater than 1.
* Useful for `counting event`s or managing access to a pool of identical resources.
* Example: Controlling access to a pool of 5 buffers.
## 3. Mutex (Mutual Exclusion Semaphore)
* Protects a `shared resource` (like UART, I2C, or a global variable) so only one task
uses it at a time.
* Has a `priority inheritance mechanism` to avoid priority inversion.
## 4. Recursive Mutex
* A special kind of mutex that allows the same task to ‚Äútake‚Äù the mutex multiple times
(as long as it gives it back the same number of times).
* Useful in cases where a function that takes a mutex is called by another function that
already holds it.
## 5. Event Groups
* A collection of bits that tasks can `wait on`.
* Tasks can wait for one or more bits to be set before continuing.
* Useful for synchronization of multiple events.
* Example: A task waits until both ‚ÄúWIFI_CONNECTED‚Äù and ‚ÄúSENSOR_READY‚Äù flags
are set.
## 6. Task Notifications (Direct-to-Task Notifications)
* Lightweight and faster than semaphores.
* Each task has a built-in `notification value` (like a private semaphore or mailbox).
* Tasks can block waiting for a notification, and ISRs or tasks can send notifications.
* Often recommended instead of binary semaphores when possible.
## 7. Message Queues
* FIFO buffers managed by the kernel.
* Used for `task-to-task` or `ISR-to-task` communication.
* You can send structured data (not just a signal) between tasks.
* Example: A producer task sends sensor readings to a queue,
and a consumer task processes them.
## 8. Stream Buffers
* One-way communication channel for continuous streams of bytes.
* Designed for sending data from ISR to task (like UART receive)..
* Works like a circular buffer managed by FreeRTOS.
## 9. Message Buffers
* Similar to stream buffers, but instead of a continuous stream,
data is sent as discrete messages (each message has a length)..
* Example: Sending packets of varying sizes between tasks.
