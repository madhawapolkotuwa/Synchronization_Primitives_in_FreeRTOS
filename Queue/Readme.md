# RTOS QUEUE

### Simple integer Queue
**FreeRTOS** integer queue safely passes data from a `producer` to a `consumer`.

### üìù Explanation of Output (Queue Example)

**Queue creation**
```c
Queue created successfully.
```
* Confirms that a queue of length 5 with item size sizeof(int) was created successfully.
* This queue will temporarily store integers from producer tasks (Task01, Task02) or from the ISR.

**First producer outputs**
```c
T1 Successfully sent count to the queue: 100
T2 Successfully sent count to the queue: 202
Successfully received value from the queue: 100
```
* Task01 (Producer 1) sends the value 100 ‚Üí toggles GPIO13.
* Task02 (Producer 2) sends the value 202 ‚Üí toggles GPIO14.
* Task03 (Consumer) dequeues the first value (100) and toggles GPIO11.

At this moment, the queue contains [202].

**Injection from ISR**
```c
T2 Successfully sent count to the queue: 202
r
Sent from ISR
```
* Task02 sends another 202.
* The user pressed r on UART ‚Üí ISR triggered, and 123 was pushed to the front of the queue.
* Queue content after this: [123, 202, 202].

**Consumer starts dequeuing**
```c
T1 Successfully sent count to the queue: 100
T2 Successfully sent count to the queue: 202
Successfully received value from the queue: 123

T2 Successfully sent count to the queue: 202
```
* Task01 sends 100, Task02 sends 202.
* Consumer dequeues 123 (injected by ISR).
    ‚úÖ Demonstrates priority effect of xQueueSendToFrontFromISR().
* Queue now has [202, 202, 100, 202, 202].

**More consumer cycles**
```c
T1 Successfully sent count to the queue: 100
Successfully received value from the queue: 202
```

* Why the output order looks "reversed"

At first glance, it looks like Task01 (producer, higher priority) was able to send 100 before Task03 (consumer, lower priority) consumed a value. But according to the code, Task01 should have been blocked because the queue was full ‚Äî so the consumer must run first to free a slot.

What actually happens internally:   
1. The queue is full when `Task01` tries to send **100**. `Task01` is placed in the Blocked state (waiting for space).
2. `Task03` (consumer) immediately gets CPU time, consumes **202**, and frees a slot in the queue.
3. As soon as the slot is freed, the scheduler wakes up the highest priority task waiting on that queue ‚Üí `Task01`.
4. `Task01` runs immediately and sends **100**.
5. After that, `Task03` continues and prints the log message for the value it consumed.

Because `Task01` has higher priority, the log message `T1 Successfully sent...` is printed before the log message `Successfully received...`, even though the consumer had to run first to make space.

That‚Äôs why the UART output looks reversed. If you step through with **breakpoints**, you‚Äôll see that the consumer actually runs first, but the higher-priority sender preempts it just before the UART print.


```c
T1 Successfully sent count to the queue: 100
Successfully received value from the queue: 202

T1 Successfully sent count to the queue: 100
Successfully received value from the queue: 100

T1 Successfully sent count to the queue: 100
Successfully received value from the queue: 202

T1 Successfully sent count to the queue: 100
Successfully received value from the queue: 202
Successfully received value from the queue: 100

T1 Successfully sent count to the queue: 100
Successfully received value from the queue: 100

T1 Successfully sent count to the queue: 100
Successfully received value from the queue: 100

T1 Successfully sent count to the queue: 100
Successfully received value from the queue: 100

T1 Successfully sent count to the queue: 100
Successfully received value from the queue: 100
```
**What happens next with Task02**

* After the first few cycles, the queue tends to fill up quickly.
* `Task02` (producer, lower priority) tries to send **202**, but if the queue is already full it will block (wait indefinitely).
* Every 5 seconds, `Task03` (consumer) runs and removes one item from the queue.
* That free slot is immediately taken by `Task01` (producer, higher priority, 4s period) because the scheduler always wakes the highest-priority task waiting on that queue.
* As a result, `Task02` never gets a chance to insert its value once the system stabilizes, and it remains blocked forever.

**Queue full case**
```c
r
Could not send from ISR Queue Full
```

* User pressed `r` again, ISR attempted to insert **123**.
* At that moment, queue already had 5 items ‚Üí ISR could not push data.
* This demonstrates queue capacity limits and correct handling of the ‚Äúqueue full‚Äù case.
